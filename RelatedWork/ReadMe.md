This folder contains references of different related work and how we are different from them. I am going to try to write also a review on the papers that we have discussed in the meeting for future reference.

## Symbolic Repairs for GR(1) Specifications

This is a journal draft version that Danielle has sent over. I should keep track of where she actually publishes it.
The paper is talking about extending AADL that is used by agree to support modeling of failures. It defines different modes of failures as well as it allows safety engineers to weave various types of faults into the nominal system model. It tries to address limitations and challenges behind determining how errors propagate through the software components, which is usually a costly and time-consuming task. 
The paper contains some description about a small model of WBS. A basic reference about WBS is found [https://www.sae.org/standards/content/air6110/](here)
